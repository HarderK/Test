		<h1>Yet another Rounded Corner Box</h1>
		<p>This is another corner box. Isn't it groovy! Forget what I said about those ohter boxes. This is my favorite box around. I mean, look at those corners. How round are they? Now take a look at the markup. That's right, no extraneous divs. Just pure HTML goodness. Sexy, huh? This one uses a single image that the browser uses to make up the sides, corners, and body of the box. Aren't they clever? They'll be making your tea next! This is another corner box.
